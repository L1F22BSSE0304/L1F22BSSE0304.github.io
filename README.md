Sarah Chen | Full Stack Developer Portfolio

Overview

This repository contains a modern, responsive, single-page portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. It is built using a minimal, high-performance stack for fast loading and easy deployment.

The entire website—including the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity—is contained within a single file (index.html).

🚀 Technology Stack

HTML5: Semantic structure for content.

Tailwind CSS (CDN): Utility-first framework for rapid, responsive, and modern styling.

Vanilla JavaScript: Used for smooth scrolling, mobile navigation toggling, and contact form simulation.

Lucide Icons (CDN): Lightweight and customizable vector icons used across the skill and project sections.

✨ Features

Fully Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Tailwind's utility classes.

Dark Theme: A professional, easy-on-the-eyes dark color scheme with an Emerald green accent.

Smooth Navigation: Scroll-to-section navigation implemented with native CSS (scroll-behavior: smooth).

Modular Sections: Clearly defined sections for Hero, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

Single-File Deployment: Extremely easy to deploy as it requires no build process or external dependencies.
